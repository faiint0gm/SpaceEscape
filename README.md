# SpaceEscape
A "stealth" game made on Warsaw Film School Game Jam 4.

Introduction : your spaceship is hijacked by a group of aliens, who killed all the crew but one girl. Girl is trying to escape the ship, but she's unarmed, and the aliens are patroling the whole place.

Main goal : go to the exit without being seen by the aliens. Use the switches on the walls to change door states.
Doors have 3 states : Open and closed (as in normal life), and (which is negative to normal life) they can change to portals.
